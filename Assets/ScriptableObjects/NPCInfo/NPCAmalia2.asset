  - "Amalia: I didn't expect you to stay here for so long, mister Clerk. What brought
    you here so late at night? Still sniffing around and trying to break into the
    Castle, aren\u2019t you? "
  - "Amalia: Fine, I\u2019ll tell you how to get in. I actually would love to see
    this place going mad with your presence, mr. Clerk."
  - "Amalia: So listen closely\u2026 There is <i>a secret path</i> through the crack
    in the wall to the east from the gates. The path is narrow, but you should be
    able to go through."
