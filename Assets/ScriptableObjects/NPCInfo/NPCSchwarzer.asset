  - "Schwarzer: Another visitor, I see\u2026 Good sir, I must inform you that this
    village belongs to the Castle, so anyone who stays here is, so to speak, staying
    at the castle. "
  - "Schwarzer: And no one\u2019s allowed to do that without a permit from the count.
    However, you don\u2019t have any such permit, or at least you haven\u2019t shown
    one."
  - "Schwarzer: Are you a land surveyor? Honestly, I don\u2019t remember the Castle
    hiring people of your profession."
  - "Schwarzer: There can\u2019t have been a mistake. Well, anyway, you cannot enter
    without a permit. And I am afraid it\u2019s impossible to get one now\u2026 or
    ever, actually. Sorry to disappoint."
